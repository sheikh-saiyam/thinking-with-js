// Problem Statement

// Given an array of integers numbers and an integer target,
// return the indices of two numbers such that they add up to target.
// If there is no solution then return undefined

// You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

// Time Complexity => O(n)

//? Input
// [2, 11, 7, 15] and 9

//? Output
// [0, 2] (because 2 + 7 = 9)
